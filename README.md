Topic: Detecting Fake News

Objective: Differentiate between real and fack news using a python project applying a possive AggressiveClassifier 

Task:
1) Read and explore the textual dataset 
2) Build a machine learning model with TfidfVectorizer and possiveAggressive classifier
3) Create a confusion matrix to evaluate the model performance
4) measure the model accuracy

Deliverables:
1) Report on detecting fack news using python covering data exploration model Building and evaluation
2) python code for data preprocessing model construction and confusion matrix generation

Learning Outcomes: 
1) Data handling and exploration for textual datasets in python
2) building a machine learning model with TfidfVectorizer and possiveAggressive Classifier
3) evaluating model performance using confusion Matrix and accuracy metrics
